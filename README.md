The DailyQuote App is a sleek, minimalist web app that displays a new inspirational quote each time you click a button. It includes a built-in text-to-speech feature that reads the quote aloud, making it both visually and audibly engaging. Designed for simplicity and performance, the app works entirely offline using a curated list of motivational quotes stored locally in JavaScriptâ€”no API keys or internet connection required.
